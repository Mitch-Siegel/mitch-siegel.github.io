I"Ú<p>I am currently thinking a lot about what the next steps of this project are, and what that means for the direction of these posts. The compiler needs a good amount more work, but it‚Äôs finally starting to become usable. That means that before too long I need to start fleshing out the VM and hardware specs. In the meantime, there‚Äôs a lot of cleanup to do, and even more issues with regard to compiler ease-of-use and practicality. With that being said, I now have some concrete visuals and benchmarks for the compiler in general.</p>

<p>Over the past week I‚Äôve been playing with graph visualization tools to try and generate an easily-digestible view of the compiler‚Äôs syntax tree. I ultimately ended up settling on a utility called <a href="https://graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>. It is an easy to use package which has incredible power and expressivity to generate all sorts of graphs. The key feature is that it can take input from a file in ‚ÄúDOT Language‚Äù containing info about nodes and edges, and then do all the heavy lifting and spit out an image file with the correct graph.</p>

<p>In order to generate the graphs, I added a function that just walks the AST and serializes it node-by-node within the compiler. That output encodes information about each node‚Äôs type, text, child, and sibling. Then, I parse that file into a Java program that reconstructs the leftmost child/right sibling tree as it was in the compiler. From there, it refactors the tree so that each node can also know a full list of all of its children. From there, all that‚Äôs left to do is to generate some formatting parameters for nodes and edges, and simply spit them out in DOT format.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what the syntax trees look like for the expressions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var i = 0;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i = i + 1</code></p>

<p>For a simple if/else statement, here‚Äôs what things look like:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if(i==2)
    return 1;
else
    return i;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve seen some simple tree representations of code, let‚Äôs step it up a notch. Remember our old friend, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstnfibs()</code>? It took an argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and calculated the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> fibonacci numbers, placing them into an array at a hardcoded location in memory. Then, it looped over that array to print each number out. Here‚Äôs its AST graph - can you figure what each statement‚Äôs source code would roughly look like?</p>

<p>The first child of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù node is the name, with the function‚Äôs argument type and name parameters as its children. All the other children of the function node are individual statements in the body of the function. The children are ordered exactly as they are parsed, the leftmost statement is the earliest.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting to see how deeply the operation nodes are nested even on a relatively simple function like this. With more complex functions it gets deep quickly.</p>
